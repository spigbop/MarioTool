The characters and assets (graphics, audio) all belong to and/or are inspired from Nintendo. This is an unofficial fan-game made by someone who grew up on awesome games those people make, so if you like this consider buying official Nintendo games.

# Console, Deferation, Total Control! (Changelog - 0.50.0)
- Adds Object Deferation as a standalone class, generator deferations now rely on it.
- Adds the Console (press ` to open by default), the console can get or set any variable or call any function.
- Adds 3 console contexes, being the game, the level, and the player. (switchable by \ by default)
- Adds the Font Baker to easily create new fonts with atlases. (Yes i did this one by one before.)
- Adds Text Methods with 2 initial naming conventions. Unicode method splits atlas textures and names character files with their unicode. Filename method is the legacy one, it uses the character itself to name files.
- Adds the 'Soap Sans' font with the unicode method to be used in the console.
- The font SMAS Outline now uses the unicode method.
- Adds the SMM2 Super Mario Bros. Forest (SNES reimagination) music track.
- Adds a new level: forest_level (currently only just a duplicate of demo level, only accesible via console)
