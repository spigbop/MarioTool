# Changelog (0.42.0 - 10/12/24)
- Adds Event blocks, when hit from below by a player any given function is called on the parent.
- Adds Switchable Generators using event blocks.
- Adds Ledge AI, when it is attached to a patrol AI it makes the object not fall from edges.
- Adds red koopa troopas.
- Red shell color is no longer unused.
- Adds pipe enemies which can spawn a singular enemy (preferably a piranha plant) when entering the spawn area and inhibits the enemy when inside the area.
- Piranha plants can now be inhibited, making them unable to appear out of a pipe until released. Piranha plants have to be the subject of a pipe enemy for this to work.
- Piranha plants now linger longer.
